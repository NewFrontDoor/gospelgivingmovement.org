            The Gospel Giving Movement is an initiative of the Hobart ministries of AFES and City Bible Forum. We want to establish a network of committed supporters, to build relationships between them and gospel workers and Christian ministries in Tasmania.<br /><br />

            We believe that giving to gospel ministry is a form of worship and is in itself a meaningful act of Christian service. <br /><br />

            Join with us as we encourage one another to give joyfully, wisely and holistically. Help us raise up a new generation of gospel givers and draw in others from around Australia who see the need to not only give locally and globally but also regionally.
